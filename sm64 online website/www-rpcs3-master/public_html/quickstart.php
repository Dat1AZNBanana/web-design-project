						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							 Both Blu-ray and PlayStation Network games must be placed in a single folder with their respective files and the folder name must correspond to the game's ID. If you are not sure what your dumped game's region ID is, you can find your region ID on the bottom side-edge of your game case. If you are no longer in possession of your game case or your game is a PlayStation Network game, you can do an internet search for <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">"Your Game Name Here</b> + <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">Region ID"</b>. Please note that it is very important you use the correct region ID.

							 • Game IDs that start with a <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">B</b> are <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">Blu-Ray Disc</b> games

							<b>Method A:</b> We recommend that you dump your own PlayStation 3 games and software from your own console. We believe that this is the most efficient and safest way to migrate your disc-based games and digital games from your console to your PC without the hassle of repairing bad game dumps found on the internet or possible legal repercussions. To do this, you will need a PlayStation 3 system with a custom firmware and various software tools that are used to rip/dump games from your system's Blu-ray drive or internal storage.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							<b>Method B:</b> You can dump games using only a computer by using select compatible Blu-ray drives. Please note that you can only use this method if an <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">.ird</b> file is available online for the decryption of the disc. See <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">Dumping games and software with a Blu-ray drive</b> below. Not every Blu-ray drive will recognize PlayStation 3 games due to how PlayStation 3 format discs are designed. Here's a compiled list of the known compatible Blu-ray drives that are capable of reading PlayStation game discs:

							 You will need three different tools for dumping PlayStation 3 game discs from a computer using a Blu-ray drive:
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							 • <a href='/cdn/tools/patcher.zip' download>PS3 ISO Patcher</a> - By BlackDaemon
						</p>
						<p>
							 • <a href='/cdn/tools/3k3y.zip' download>3k3y ISO Tools</a> - By the 3k3y team
						</p>
						<p>
							 • <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">ISO Dumping Software</b>, such as <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/">ImgBurn</a>, for example.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							 1. Insert a PlayStation 3 Blu-ray disc game of your choice.
						</p>
						<p>
							 2. Dump the <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">.iso</b> image using an ISO Dumping program such as ImgBurn.
						</p>
						<p>
							 3. Use <a href="http://jonnysp.bplaced.net">jonnysp.bplaced.net</a> to locate the appropriate <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">.ird</b> file that matches your game ID. If there isn't any .ird file that matches your game ID this unfortunately means you can't dump your disc using this method.
						</p>
						<p>
							 4. Be sure to check game ID in case of different game editions. You need to use the file for the exact game ID, otherwise it won't work (<i>for example: .ird file for Demon's Souls US disc doesn't work with Demon's Souls EU disc</i>).
							<p>
								 5. Open <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">PS3 ISO Patcher</b> and select your dumped <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">.iso</b> file and its appropriate <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">.ird</b> file.
							</p>
							<p>
								 6. Press <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">Patch</b> to apply the patch to the .iso file.
							</p>
							<p>
								 7. Open <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">3k3y ISO Tools</b>. Click the <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">ISO Crypto</b> option and select the dumped .iso file to decrypt it. Make sure the .iso file extension is in lower-case letters (.iso not .ISO), or the decryption will not work.
							</p>
							<p>
								 8. Your game should now be properly decrypted.
							</p>
							<p>
								 9. While in 3k3y ISO Tools, in the Tools drop-down menu, select <b class="txt-highlight darkmode-highlight">ISO -> Extract ISO</b> and select the decrypted iso file to extract the game files (the decrypted iso file will have a .dec.iso file extension).
							</p>
							<p>
								 10. You are now able to use your successfully dumped disc-based game with RPCS3.

						<div id='featured-tx2-block' class="darkmode-txt">
							<p>
								<b>Renderer</b><br>
								 Allows you to select OpenGL, Vulkan and D3D12 renderers. Vulkan will always be the fastest renderer, followed by OpenGL, the most accurate renderer. This is due to OpenGL receiving bug fixes and implementations ahead of the other renderers.
								 <i>Note that D3D12 (Direct3D 12) is only compatible with Windows 10 and its usage is not recommended as it's unmantained.</i>
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>Resolution</b><br>
								 Allows you to set the native rendering resolution for the emulated console. See the supported resolutions for the game you're testing on the Game List and pick any of those. 
								 <i>Note that not all games render at 1080p because a real PlayStation 3 doesn't support this resolution on all games</i>
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>Graphics Device</b><br>
								 Allows you to select your preferred GPU for usage in the Vulkan and D3D12 renderers.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>Aspect Ratio</b><br>
								 Defines the aspect ratio of the the emulated console.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>Frame Limit</b><br>
								 In most cases, this setting should be set to either Off if the game has internal framelocking or Auto if the game doesn't and goes above 60fps. Otherwise, some games may surpass their 30/60FPS target causing issues such as sped-up gameplay or physics glitches. Games are only intended to run up to 60FPS on a real PlayStation 3. 
								 <i>Using Frame Limit will slow down your game if it doesn't run fast enough, so use it only if needed.</i>
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>Write Color Buffers</b><br>
								 These buffers are only required for some bigger AAA games. Demon's Souls requires the use of the Write Color buffers option.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>Invalidate Cache Every Frame</b><br>
								 Improves the way shadows are handled. Use this only if your game displays broken shadows.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>Use GPU texture scaling</b><br>
								 Improves performance by offloading some texture scaling over to the GPU. In rare cases, this option may cause texture corruption.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>Strict Rendering Mode</b><br>
								 Enforces strict compliance to the graphical API specification. Might result in degraded performance in some games. Can resolve rare cases of missing graphics and flickering. 
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>VSync</b><br>
								 Improves image quality by keeping framerate consistent. Disabling may cause screen tearing but may also improve performance in some cases.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>Stretch to display area</b><br>
								 Overrides aspect ratio and stretches the image to full display area.

XAudio2 should always be used on Windows operating systems for proper audio playback, and ALSA/PulseAudio should always be used on Linux systems.
